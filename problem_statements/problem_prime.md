> ## Take a integer `n` as an input. find whether given number is `prime number `. Repeat this checking for `t` testcases.
`Prime number` Checking must be in method and `O(âˆšn)` in complexity. Prime method `return type` must be `boolean`.


> Test case 0 :</br>
  `2`</br>
  `12`</br>
  `17`</br>

> Output :</br>
`12 is Not Prime`</br>
`17 is Prime`</br>


**Explanation**

- t = 2 testcases
- 12 which is not prime
- 17 which is prime
