> ## Input two strings `s` and `p`. Find whether `s` and `p` are `anagrams` to each other. Two strings are anagrams when both strings have same type of characters with same frequency. Ex : `s="abbd"`, `p="bdba"` are `anagrams.` Return `True` if anagrams else `False`.


> Test case 0 :</br>
  `asdfa`</br>
  `sdaaf`</br>

> Output :</br>
`True`</br>


**Explanation**

- s = asdfa
- p = sdaaf
- `s` and `p` have same frequency of characters. So they `anagrams` to each other.
