Take n number of strings with length m as input. find the frequency of characters in each string. 
print the mimimum sequence of frequencies .


test case 0:

2 9
gabacddbd
baabdfgfg


out put:

12213

explanation :

n = 2 strings

m = 9 length of each string

frequencies of gabacddbd is 1 2 2 1 3
frequencies of baabdfgfg is 2 2 1 2 2

12213 < 22122

so min freq seq is 12213
