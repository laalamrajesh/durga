**Take n number of strings with length m as input. find the frequency of characters in each string. 
print the mimimum sequence of frequencies .**


> Test case 0 :
  `2 9`
  `gabacddbd`
  `baabdfgfg`

> Output :
`12213`


**Explanation **

- n = 2 strings
- m = 9 length of each string
- frequencies of gabacddbd is 1 2 2 1 3
- frequencies of baabdfgfg is 2 2 1 2 2
- 12213 < 22122
- so min freq seq is 12213
